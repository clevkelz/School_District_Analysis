# School District Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### _Initial Analysis_
A review of reading and math scores for a large school district with 15 high schools was conducted to provide a snapshot of district performance. Summaries were provided both on the student and district level.  Tables were produced to measure school performance based on the passing rate for both math and reading scores.  Schools were then divided into groups by the number of students, type of school (charter and district), and by grade level.
### _Additional Review_
After the initial analysis was completed, the school board found evidence of potential academic dishonesty at one oh the schools; specifically, reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School appeared to have been altered. The steps taken in the initial analysis were then repeated after removing the data for the suspect data.  The results were reevaluated to determine if this potentially erroneous data impacted performance at that specific school and for the district overall.
## Results
Eight school metrics were evaluated as follows:
1. District Summary â€“ Overall information was compiled for the entire district by the number of schools and students, the total budget, average math and reading scores, the percentage of students passing math and reading, and, finally, the percentage of students passing both.

The removal of the data showing potential academic dishonesty did not have a large impact on the overall passing rate for math or reading.  There were slight declines in the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both areas.  These results are not unexpected as number of ninth graders at Thomas High School (the impacted group) was only 1.2% of all students in the district. (461 students out of the entire district population of 39,170.)
