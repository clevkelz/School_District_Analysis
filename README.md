# School District Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### _Initial Analysis_
A review of reading and math scores for a large school district with 15 high schools was conducted to provide a snapshot of district performance. Summaries were provided both on the student and district level.  Tables were produced to measure school performance based on the passing rate for both math and reading scores.  Schools were then divided into groups by the number of students, type of school (charter and district), and by grade level.
### _Additional Review_
After the initial analysis was completed, the school board found evidence of potential academic dishonesty at one oh the schools; specifically, reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School appeared to have been altered. The steps taken in the initial analysis were then repeated after removing the data for the suspect data.  The results were reevaluated to determine if this potentially erroneous data impacted performance at that specific school and for the district overall.
